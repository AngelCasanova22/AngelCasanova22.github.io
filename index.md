## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
Lab 1
I found this lab very nice and easy, as it was the first lab. I enjoyed it being the basic introduction to coding and I thought this was a good starting point for someone like me, who has never coded anything in my entire life. It was very simple and straightforward and it is amazing to look back and see how far I have come from the beginning of the semester.

Lab 6, Part 2
I found this part of the lab very interesting and intriguing because I love to play card games with my friends, whether it’s poker or blackjack. Being able to code something like blackjack, where the program can tell whether it’s an ace card, face card, or just a number card and then add them up to tell you whether it's a bust or not is very amazing. It makes me wonder what else you can code into this program, such as being able to run the probability of what card could come next. 

Lab 9, Part 2
I enjoyed this part of the lab because it was like a game to me. The labs that are the most fun and enjoyable are the ones that are almost like a game, like this one where one person has a secret number and the other person has to try and guess the number within one try. This lab was fairly straightforward and my partner made this lab very enjoyable for me.
